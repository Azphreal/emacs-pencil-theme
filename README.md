# Pencil theme for Emacs

This is port of [Pencil theme for ViM](https://github.com/reedes/vim-colors-pencil) for Emacs. This is just a draft now. If you want to add colors specific for some modes, ask me or contribute (of course, second is better).

Currently supports:
- company-mode
- flycheck/make
- rainbow-delimeters
- powerline
- spaceline
- rust-mode
- org-mode
- latex-mode (working progress)
- diff/ediff
- magit
- helm/ivy
- which-key

# Notes
Over time, I've customised the theme to be less faithful to the original and more of what I want. However, I've included these as optional features.

- `pencil/nebula`:(boolean)  use a background that's slightly bluer than the default
- `pencil/variable-family`: (string) if non-nil, use a variable-width typeface for strings and documentation
