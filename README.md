# Pencil theme for Emacs

This is port of [Pencil theme for ViM](https://github.com/reedes/vim-colors-pencil) for Emacs. This is just a draft now. If you want to add colors specific for some modes, ask me or contribute (of course, second is better).

Currently supports:
- company-mode
- flycheck/make
- rainbow-delimeters
- powerline
- spaceline
- rust-mode
- org-mode
- diff/ediff
- magit
- helm/ivy
